Creative Space

Creative space is a platform for any form of creative artist or people in general to put together their portfolio and build up an audience at the same time.Every person needs and has their own creative space, the joy of creating and finishing something you started is an immense one, and it must be shared with the world.

Our web application focuses on giving artists the reach they deserve.

Every user is to have their personal and global space. A user has the option to upload a wide range of files depending on their creative medium such as their artwork, photography, video works, blog posts etc.

The global spotlight is a dedicated feed meant for users to find inspiration from other creators and for the creators to build an audience for their content.

The private mode consists of their own space and a user network where the user can manage and share their creative space with limited permissions with other users.

A user can also download his content in original quality from the server anywhere, which makes creative space his small creative briefcase to store and carry content. In many cases, a user’s creative space also acts like a creative portfolio.

This web app is different from any other social networking application in the present time because -

1. It solves the problem of having to maintain an account in every one of these social sites.
2. It’s all about the user’s work and building his collection instead of the primary motive of sharing it with other’s that comes with other social websites.
3. Manage private and global fields separately.

For example, in Facebook, if a user change settings to ‘all’, every user gets access to every file. And if privacy settings are altered to friends, there remains no scope of presenting something at the global level. More over Facebook is built on personal sentiments. (Our spotlight will be a common place for all users to view other user’s content and the users will be informed when some of their work gets featured on the spotlight; basically, spotlight will be a grand stage which won’t just be given to popular artists but to everybody having a creative space on our application.)

What we aim for is a more professional community giving casual creators a reach and a stage to feel good about their creativity.

Moreover, we are unifying the likes of Instragram, Behance, Blogspot, DeviantArt by providing a medium for all sort of creators and that is why our project should be given a chance.

For our frontend we will be using HTML, CSS, JScript, jQuery, AngularJS and SVG. For our backend, node.js, MongoDB and JSON.
